# Data-Centric-RAD-Project
This is my 3rd year project for my Data Centric RAD module in college. The brief for this project is to write a JSF/JDBC dynamic web application that queries and updates a MySQL database.

#### Module
This was a semester long module which covered
+ Relational Databases (MySQL)
+ Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)
+ Java Server Faces (JSF)

This project was worth 50% of the module.

#### Setting up the database
The database used for this project is provided. To import the database use the following command:
'''
mysql -u username -p password < "Full Path\GarageDB.sql"
'''

The server must be running to use the application. I used WAMP for this project.
